Benefits:
1.from the above project we understand the functions of pandas
2.from the above project we can understand the importance of pandas
3. we learn how to draw histograph and whether it is left or right skew
4.we learn many many libraries mathplots which are available in machine learning
5.we learn how to use with the github and google colab and we gained experience 
Conclusion:
So, we finally used machine learning and mathplot and libraries to make histograph and describe variable in the data

       Thanks for providing precious opportunity to us.
